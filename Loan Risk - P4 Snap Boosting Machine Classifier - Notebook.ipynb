    "- This pipeline is optimized for the original data set. The pipeline might fail or produce sub-optimal results if used with different data.  If you want to use a different data set, consider retraining the AutoAI experiment to generate a new pipeline. For more information, see <a href=\"https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/autoai-notebook.html\">Cloud Platform</a>. \n",
